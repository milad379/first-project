## This is my first project automating things inshaAllah 

### Going through the Terraform bootcamp by Chris 

In this bootcamp, we are going to *automate* deploying our application in AWS using **Cloudfront and a S3 bucket**.

During this process, I will be documenting the steps taken to create the solution. And here are some of the methods we can make our files more user friendly. 

```
# Simple Python program to greet the user

# Prompt the user for their name
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Greet the user
print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to the world of Python programming.")

```

To make a list, add - infront of the items; like,

- list 1
- list 2

when possible, use color code; like,

```python
# Simple Python program to greet the user

# Prompt the user for their name
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Greet the user
print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to the world of Python programming.")

```

```bash

# Simple Bash script to prompt the user for input

echo "Enter your name: "
read user_name

echo "Hello, $user_name! Welcome to the world of Bash scripting."
```
