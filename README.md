## This is my first project automating things inshaAllah

### Going through the Terraform bootcamp by Chris

In this bootcamp, we are going to *automate* deploying our application in AWS using **Cloudfront and a S3 bucket**. 

During this process, I will be documenting the steps taken to create the solution.

```
# Simple Python program to greet the user

# Prompt the user for their name
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Greet the user
print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to the world of Python programming.")

```
